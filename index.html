    It has been more than 59,96,16,000 seconds since this beautiful girl (angel) has come to this world. <br>
  It has also been 57,30,91,200 seconds since this dumbass ME was born. <br>

 But this message is about one second, that one second, The second, when I‚Äôve seen this special girl for the first time‚Ä¶. <br>

 19,72,51,200 seconds has passed since that one second‚Ä¶<br>

 This special girl,<strong>RAM SRI MUTYALA</strong> , <br>

 Her words, <br>

 Nope, not just words they are like worlds best melody songs to me. I wish I could listen to her every second. <br>

 Her face, <br>

 One of the most beautiful faces I‚Äôve seen. I spent hours just by looking at her pictures. <br>

 Must notable point, <br>

 Damn she is intelligent AF. <br>

 ‚ÄúYou are the sister of my life. No. you are THE SISTER of all my 7 lives. <br>

 No matter how the times are or how my day was... I will never let it end without texting you. <br>

 To be frank I am very very scared of losing you. <br>

 I can‚Äôt imagine of something where we are not in touch or spoken or texted for a single day. <br>

 At times I might not text you the whole day but trust me that day remains incomplete in my life. <br>

 Or that day might be my end. <br>

 (or that day would be like I was left alone at the centre of Sahara desert and I couldn‚Äôt find a mobile to text you or call you. ) <br>

 Love you to death. ( not this life.. the last one of my 7 lives. Trust me I will also try to love you even beyond death.. even beyond my existence.. even further beyond this universe‚Äôs existence.)‚Äù <br>
